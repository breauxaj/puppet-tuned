tuned
=====

tuned is a system service that lets you select a tuning profile from one of the
nine profiles shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, or any that you’ve
written yourself. Tuning profiles include sysctl settings (/proc/sys/), settings
for disk-elevators, power management options, transparent hugepages, and any
scripts that you might want to add yourself.
